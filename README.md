# School_District_Analysis
Overview of the school district analysis: 
     The purpose of this project is to find performance trends and patterns based on standardized tests from 15 schools in the district. This analysis was conducted twice due to academic dishonesty from ninth grade students at Thomas High School. In order to uphold the state-testing standards all of the ninth grade reading, and math scores were replaced with NaNs. 
 
How is the district summary affected?

There are a few slight differences in the data after replacing the ninth grades scores from Thomas High School with NaNs. In the updated data set the average reading scores were not affected whereas the average math scores decreased by .02. The percentage of passing math scores decreased by .02. The percentage of passing reading scores decreased by .03 and overall passing percentage increased by.02.

How is the school summary affected?  

The math, reading and overall passing percentages in the school summary were severely affected. The passing reading percentage was affected the most. Originally the percentage for passing reading was 97.3%. After correcting the data, the percentage for passing reading is now 70%.

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools? 
Replacing the math and reading scores did not affect Thomas High School’s performance compared to other schools. 

Here’s how replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading schools affected the analysis.

 •	The math and reading scores by grade were not affected other than the 9th grade scores for Thomas High School were changed to NaNs.
 
 •	Replacing the ninth graders scores did not affect the scores by school spending.
 
 •	The scores by school size remained the same as they were in the original analysis.        
 
 •	The scores by school type remained the same and were not affected by the replaced grades.

Summary

In conclusion replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores with NaNs created few changes to the outcome. Unfortunately, the academic dishonesty from the ninth graders at Thomas High School, did cause the districts average scores and overall passing percentage to heavily decrease. Thomas High school remained the number two school.
